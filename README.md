# Project-1-Covid-19-Info-Tracker

This program is intended to provide relevant, up-to-date information about the impact and spread of the Coronavirus. Fundamentally, a user should be able to find aggregate data pertaining to the spread of the coronavirus on a country-by-country basis, as well as choose from a handful of specific search terms relating to the disease. In turn, the requested information will then be queried from the relevant server-side APIs and displayed through DOM manipulation. In addition, we have chosen to include a small selection of charities that users may wish to donate their time or resources towards, should they be so inclined. 

## Intended Usage

Plainly, the intended audience and user-base for this app is anyone that would like a more visual representation of the current progression of the pandemic currently sweeping the nation - as a result of the APIs used in its creation, this app should remain relevant and up-to-date for the foreseeable future. That said, I would personally recommend a more complete timeline map, such as the website associated with the tracker API that we used, for actual, real-life usage: https://thevirustracker.com/coronavirus-timeline-map. This is ultimately a school project, after all, and not something to be relied upon at this stage in our development.
